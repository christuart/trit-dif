material		density		density-unit		diffusion-constant		diffusion-unit
steel			7.85		g/cm^3			0.005				m^2/s
polymer			0.9		g/cm^3			0.0000000005			m^2/s
air			0.0012		g/cm^3			0.000001			m^2/s
concrete		2.4		g/cm^3			0.00000000001			m^2/s
note that concrete diffusion constant was just made up on the spot
steel D is currently set at 10^13 higher than it was before, to use au and have the source contamination as just "1"
